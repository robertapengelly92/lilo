# A RAID installation is called for.  With (version 22) of LILO
# the boot record will be installed on the RAID partition.  The
# Master Boot Record will find the record on (hda2), which is marked
# as an active partition.  (sdb1) is also marked active.  If (hda) fails,
# it will be possible to boot by disabling the IDE controller in BIOS,
# which will cause (sdb) to become device 0x80, and boot appropriately.

boot = /dev/md1

#
# Auxiliary boot records will be installed automatically.  Since
# this is a PARALLEL raid device, there will be no boot records
# other that the one written to the RAID set  (sdb1, hda2).

raid-extra-boot = auto

#
# The SCSI controller BIOS assigns device codes backwards
# from what one might expect, so we make the BIOS device
# code assignment by the BIOS explict:

disk=/dev/hda
   bios=0x80
disk=/dev/sda
   bios=0x82
disk=/dev/sdb
   bios=0x81

# Always prompt for a boot selection, timing out after
# 30.0 seconds

  timeout=300

#
# Use the MENU interface, specifying the title and color scheme
#
#install = /boot/boot-menu.b	# versions before 22.3

install = menu			# syntax since 22.3 ("text", "menu", "bmp")
menu-title = " RAID boot on CARMEN "
menu-scheme = "wk:Wg:wk:Gk"

#
#  Specify the kernel to boot if the use makes no selection
#  withing the 'timeout=' period.

# 
#  Both kernels below use the same root directory, which
#  is mounted initially "read-only"
